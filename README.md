# MWTAS
Mobile Wi-Fi Time Attendance System.
The idea is to set a static IP Address for the device you want to Monitor, Once the device owner walks into the place and he is hooked to the WI-FI/AP automatically MWTAS detects the IP Address and Employee name then logs the time to database.

The idea itself may look stupid but it helped to solve 2 issues in our office, as our employees are equipped with android phones for business:
- The time attendance for our employees (Using IP Address & MAC Address of mobile phones).
- The location of employees inside a 4 floors building (Using IP Address & Different Subnets).


WI-FI Should be always enabled and connected on the selected devices.

Your contribution in the code & idea is more than welcome.
